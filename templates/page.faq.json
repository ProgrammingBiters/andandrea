Some countries allow their citizens to import up to a specified maximum dollar value without any additional charges. However, the laws vary  from country to country—check with the customs office in your country so that you’re not surprised when your order arrives. Please note that DHL may request a payment at (or in some cases, before) delivery. This is not a shipping charge, it’s a payment your government collects on international goods. DHL pays the customs authority in your country for any duties and taxes that you owe for your andAndrea order. They do so that your shipment arrives as quickly as possible—otherwise, your gorgeous new goodies would get held up in customs. Before or at the time of delivery, DHL will ask you to reimburse them for the amount they paid on your behalf. andAndrea is not responsible for any costs associated with returns caused by customers refusing to pay their government’s duty or taxes. Two-way shipping costs will be deducted from any refunds caused in this way. If you decide to refuse your order, when it arrives at our returns centre, we’ll deduct the two-way shipping costs plus a small administrative fee when processing your refund (for items received within our standard returns timeline). <\/p>","open":false}},"286483bf-abd3-490f-8cb8-662f84952c36":{"type":"accordion","settings":{"icon":"none","title":"Can I buy things at other times or only when you have a PopUp Party?","text":"<p>Our products are only available during our 72-hour online PopUp Parties, which usually occur every six to eight weeks.  <\/p>","open":false}},"c1218de7-1f3a-49a9-bf6a-f6b1408d7427":{"type":"accordion","settings":{"icon":"none","title":"Why do two similar items have different prices?","text":"<p>All items are priced after they arrive at our warehouse.
